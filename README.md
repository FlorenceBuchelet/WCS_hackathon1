# HACKATHON

24h of coding with one single obligation: the project must be about christmas.
Since we were not christmas enthusiasts, we decided on a quizz to help our fellow christmas skeptics with excuses to avoid the dreaded festivities.
It was a messy, delirious and sleep-deprived project (COVID helped). Congratulations to Marie for being the only one who stayed healthy while the three of us were coding in a fever induced haze. 

Anyway, we won! üòÅ
